I am a scientific machine learning engineer with expertise in applied mathematics and deep learning. I build reliable, high-performance solutions to scientific challenges by combining mathematical insight with modern AI techniques.

Real-world data (e.g in medical/seismic imaging), is often sparse, noisy, or worse of all both! These can cause models to generalize very poorly, reducing their practical value. Traditional methods to address these issues—like outlier removal, data augmentation, transfer learning, or GANs—can be computationally expensive, risk losing meaningful data, or cause models to overfit.Add commentMore actions

A cheap and promising alternative is to make machine learning models physics aware. This is an innovative approach that can be done in several ways, for example, by embedding physical constraints directly into ML models. This approach can enhance model accuracy, interpretability, stability, and significantly reduces reliance on large datasets. Importantly, these methods complement and sometimes outperform traditional numerical methods, tackling issues like the curse of dimensionality, complex boundary conditions and nonlinear problems effectively.

I am particularly interested in overcoming some of the major challenges this exciting area still faces:

- Ensuring scalability to large and complex problems.
- Improving computational efficiency to make these methods accessible in practice.

I am always open to conversations, collaborations, and new opportunities in the academic and industrial settings.(idrisoduola47@gmail.com)

I am a scientific machine learning specialist with about 3 years of experience, particularly passionate about developing physics-based machine learning models.

Real-world data (e.g in medical/seismic imaging), is often sparse, noisy, or worse of all both! These can cause models to generalize very poorly, reducing their practical value. Traditional methods to address these issues—like outlier removal, data augmentation, transfer learning, or GANs—can be computationally expensive, risk losing meaningful data, or cause models to overfit.

A cheap and promising alternative is to make machine learning models physics aware. This is an innovative approach that can be done in several ways, for example, by embedding physical constraints directly into ML models. This approach can enhance model accuracy, interpretability, stability, and significantly reduces reliance on large datasets. Importantly, these methods complement and sometimes outperform traditional numerical methods, tackling issues like the curse of dimensionality, complex boundary conditions and nonlinear problems effectively.

I am particularly interested in overcoming some of the major challenges this exciting area still faces:

- Establishing robust theoretical guarantees.
- Ensuring scalability to large and complex problems.
- Improving computational efficiency to make these methods accessible in practice.

I am always open to conversations, collaborations, and new opportunities in scientific and industrial settings.(idrisoduola47@gmail.com)

I am an applied mathematician with a strong interest in computational science, and in using machine learning approaches to enhance traditional numerical methods. My aim is to build reliable, high-performance solutions to scientific problems by combining my maturity in mathematics with modern AI techniques. Particularly, I am interested in overcoming some of the major challenges this exciting area still faces:

- Ensuring scalability of algorithms to large and complex problems.
- Improving reliability and generalizability of machine learning approaches to problems in science and engineering.

I am always open to conversations, collaborations, and new opportunities in the academic and industrial settings.(idrisoduola47@gmail.com)
